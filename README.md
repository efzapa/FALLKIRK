# DEVELOPMENT FREEZE

## This codebase is currently under a development freeze, until changes are implemented that are being implemented in a private repo can be brought over. The private repo is not being actively hosted anywhere. The only PRs that will be considered at this time are small bug fixes.

# Blackstone
Blackstone is a fantasy roleplaying game based on the source code for Roguetown, and is inspired by Table Top Roleplaying Games. The goal of Blackstone is to provide a freeform fantasy roleplay environment with minimal admin intervention, where players are empowered to collectively decide what is and is not acceptable through in-game action.
